Description of Project:
The Virtual Library Registry System is an online platform that enables users to browse, and borrow digital books. The system is inspired by online databases while trying to resemble a library experience. Users will have the ability to search for books, view descriptions, borrow books, and maintain a history or borrowed books. This is going to be tracked through a users created account, which they will have to sign into in order to track and borrow books. Likewise there will be an admin role for select users, which will place the responsibility of updating data related to the book collection.

List of features:

User Authentication and Registration:
Users can create accounts and log in with a username and password. The default permission is given by the system as a visitor, and there will be also be an admin designation.

Admin Dashboard:
An administrative interface for managing the collection, including adding new books, updating book information, and removing outdated books.

Book Cataloging:
Given a catalog of books, the users will have the ability to browse available books by title, authors, publication year, and genre. Selecting a book will provide a description about the specific book.

Book Borrowing System:
Users can borrow books from the libraryâ€™s digital collection for a specified period. The system will set and manage borrowing limits, due dates. Once a user returns a book they will be asked if they want to leave a review. (0-5 stars)
